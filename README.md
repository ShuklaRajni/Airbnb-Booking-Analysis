# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis

# Summary:
Data analysis on thousands of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. Our main objective is to find out the key metrics that influence the listing of properties on the platform. For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We have found out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors. We have analyzed this dataset from different angles and have come up with interesting insights. This can help in making strategic data-driven decisions by the marketing team, finance team and technical team of Airbnb.

# Objective:
Our goal here is to explore the data and find useful insights from the data and find out different relations between the columns.This project analyzes NYC Airbnb data to explore the differences in price and availability among different area groups in NYC, to identify the busiest hosts in NYC.

# Introduction:
Since its founding, Airbnb has hosted over 60 million people in 34,000 cities across the world and is continuing to grow quickly. Airbnb provides a convenient source of income for people who have otherwise vacant space and for guests looking for affordable and convenient housing options. With any service, trying to monitor and understand the underlying pricing dynamics of the Airbnb market is very important both for hosts and guests. As users continue to grow on both the supply and demand side, homeowners may find it hard to properly price their property. Airbnb has recognized this and conducted considerable research into suggesting pricing from a supply side standpoint.

# Problem statement: 
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations in that locale. NYC is the most populous city in the United States, and one of the most popular tourism and business places globally. Airbnb would like to understand customers and providerâ€™s behavior and performance on the platform, marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services etc.
